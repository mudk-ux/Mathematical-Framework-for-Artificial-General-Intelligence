# LLM-Enhanced Multi-Modal Adaptive Intelligence (MMAI) System

This extension of the unified MMAI system integrates large language models (LLMs) via Amazon Bedrock to create a powerful agentic system with advanced reasoning capabilities.

## Overview

The LLM-enhanced MMAI system combines the mathematical rigor of the original MMAI framework with the reasoning capabilities of large language models to create a hybrid system that can:

1. Make strategic decisions with sophisticated reasoning
2. Analyze complex patterns across multiple modalities
3. Synthesize insights from collective memory
4. Predict equilibrium dynamics with game-theoretic understanding
5. Adapt to changing environments with greater flexibility

## Key Components

### LLM-Powered Agents

The system includes LLM-powered agents that can:
- Reason about their environment and strategic options
- Explain their decision-making process
- Detect and respond to hypersensitive points
- Learn from past experiences through memory integration

### LLM-Enhanced Memory System

The memory system is enhanced with LLM capabilities for:
- Sophisticated memory retrieval based on semantic understanding
- Memory synthesis to extract patterns and insights
- Anomaly detection in memory patterns
- Strategic recommendations based on historical patterns

### LLM-Enhanced Nash Validator

The Nash validator is enhanced with LLM capabilities for:
- Advanced equilibrium analysis
- Strategic pattern recognition
- Payoff matrix interpretation
- Prediction of equilibrium shifts

## Amazon Bedrock Integration

The system integrates with Amazon Bedrock to access state-of-the-art language models:
- Claude models from Anthropic
- Titan models from Amazon
- Other compatible models available through Bedrock

## Usage

### Running a Simulation

To run an LLM-enhanced simulation:

```bash
python run_llm_simulation.py --n-agents 10 --max-steps 20 --grid-size 20 --llm-agent-ratio 0.5
```

### Key Parameters

- `--model-id`: Amazon Bedrock model ID (default: `anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0`)
- `--region`: AWS region for Bedrock (default: `us-east-1`)
- `--llm-agent-ratio`: Ratio of LLM agents to total agents (default: `0.5`)
- `--grid-size`: Size of the environment grid (default: `20`)
- `--n-agents`: Initial number of agents (default: `10`)
- `--max-steps`: Maximum number of simulation steps (default: `20`)

### AWS Configuration

Ensure your AWS credentials are properly configured with access to Amazon Bedrock:

```bash
aws configure
```

## Implementation Details

### LLM Agent

The `LLMAgent` class extends the base `Agent` class with LLM-based reasoning:

```python
agent = LLMAgent(
    agent_id=1,
    position=[10, 10],
    model_id="anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0",
    region="us-east-1",
    n_strategies=3
)

decision, reasoning = agent.make_decision(environment_state, strategic_field, memory_system)
```

### LLM-Enhanced Memory System

The `LLMEnhancedMemorySystem` extends the base `MemorySystem` with advanced capabilities:

```python
memory_system = LLMEnhancedMemorySystem(
    capacity=1000,
    n_frames=10,
    model_id="anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0",
    region="us-east-1"
)

# Retrieve memories with LLM reasoning
memories = memory_system.retrieve_relevant_memories(query_state, k=5)

# Synthesize insights from memories
insights = memory_system.synthesize_memories(memories)
```

### LLM-Enhanced Nash Validator

The `LLMEnhancedNashValidator` extends the base `NashValidator` with game theory analysis:

```python
nash_validator = LLMEnhancedNashValidator(
    n_strategies=3,
    model_id="anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0",
    region="us-east-1"
)

# Analyze equilibrium dynamics
analysis = nash_validator.analyze_equilibrium_dynamics()

# Analyze payoff matrix
payoff_analysis = nash_validator.analyze_payoff_matrix()

# Predict strategy evolution
prediction = nash_validator.predict_strategy_evolution(time_horizon=10)
```

## Performance Considerations

LLM-enhanced simulations are more computationally intensive and slower than standard simulations. Consider these guidelines:

1. Start with smaller simulations (fewer agents, smaller grid, fewer steps)
2. Use caching to reduce redundant LLM calls
3. Monitor LLM response times and adjust parameters accordingly
4. Consider using smaller, faster models for frequent operations

## Extending the System

### Adding New LLM Capabilities

To add new LLM capabilities:

1. Create a new method in the appropriate class
2. Design a prompt that clearly specifies the task and desired output format
3. Implement response parsing and error handling
4. Add caching for performance optimization

### Creating Custom LLM Components

To create a new LLM-enhanced component:

1. Extend the base component class
2. Add Amazon Bedrock client initialization
3. Implement LLM querying methods with proper error handling
4. Add caching mechanisms for performance
5. Implement performance tracking

## Future Directions

1. **Multi-model integration**: Incorporate multiple LLM models for different specialized tasks
2. **Adaptive prompting**: Dynamically adjust prompts based on simulation state
3. **Cross-agent communication**: Enable direct LLM-mediated communication between agents
4. **Hierarchical agent structures**: Create supervisor agents that coordinate groups of standard agents
5. **Emergent language development**: Study how agents develop communication protocols
