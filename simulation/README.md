# Mass Action of the Mass Action Interpretation of Nash Equilibrium (MMAI) Simulation

This unified system integrates the theoretical framework from "Steps Towards AGI" with robust simulation capabilities to study adaptive intelligence in multi-modal environments.

## Overview

The MMAI simulation implements:

- Information Retrieval Network (IRN) for individual and collective memory
- Strategic field representation with wave-like propagation
- Fractal time architecture with multiple temporal scales (dt, t, T)
- Nash equilibrium tracking with mass-action interpretation
- Hypersensitive points analysis for strategic decision-making
- Environmental dynamics with periodic, chaotic, and shock patterns
- Resource dynamics with growth and consumption models
- Comprehensive experiment management and visualization tools

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- psutil (optional, for performance monitoring)

## Usage

To run the main simulation:

```bash
python run_simulation.py
```

For a specific experiment:

```bash
python run_simulation.py --experiment strategic_fields
```

## Experiments

The system includes several pre-configured experiments:

1. **Strategic Fields**: Analyzes the formation and propagation of strategic fields
2. **Nash Equilibrium**: Studies the emergence of Nash equilibria across temporal scales
3. **Hypersensitive Points**: Examines the impact of hypersensitive points on decision-making
4. **Temporal Resonance**: Investigates resonance patterns across temporal scales
5. **Resource Dynamics**: Explores the interaction between resources and strategic behavior

## Outputs

The simulation generates:
- Log files (`simulation_*.log`)
- Visualization images (`simulation_state_*.png`, `strategic_field_*.png`)
- Analysis data (`simulation_results_*.json`, `simulation_analysis_*.json`)
- Manuscript-quality figures (`manuscript_figure_*.png`)

## Theoretical Foundation

This implementation is based on the theoretical framework described in "Steps Towards AGI," which proposes a mathematical encoding of synthetic intelligence through:

- Strategic field formation and propagation
- Mass-action interpretation of Nash equilibrium
- Fractal temporal architecture
- Stigmergic coordination through the IRN
- Hypersensitive points for strategic decision-making
