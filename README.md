## Overview

This repository presents a novel mathematical framework for achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) through the integration of strategic fields, collective memory systems, and Nash equilibrium dynamics. Rather than pursuing increasingly complex individual computational units, our approach demonstrates how intelligence emerges from the strategic interaction of simpler components through well-defined mathematical principles.

### Key Contributions

- **Mass-Action Interpretation Extension**: Novel mathematical formulation extending Nash equilibrium theory to infinite populations with memory
- **Strategic Field Theory**: Wave-theoretic approach to modeling strategic information propagation through space and time
- **Fractal Time Architecture**: Multi-scale temporal framework enabling coherent behavior across different time scales
- **Information Retrieval Network (IRN)**: Dual individual/collective memory system enabling stigmergic coordination
- **Comprehensive Simulation Framework**: Empirical validation through five key experiments demonstrating theoretical predictions

## Theoretical Foundation

Our framework is built on the premise that artificial general intelligence can emerge from the perfect integration of:

1. **Strategic Fields**: Multidimensional wave representations of strategic information
2. **Memory Systems**: Individual and collective memory through the Information Retrieval Network
3. **Equilibrium Formation**: Nash equilibria emerging proportional to system growth across multiple scales

The mathematical core is the Mass-Action of Mass-Action Interpretation (M.M.A.I):

```
S‚àû = lim[t‚Üí‚àû] ‚à´ PPP(s,p,ùí¢) dt
```

Where S‚àû represents strategic singularity, and PPP represents Population-Payoff-Perception dynamics with growth rate ùí¢.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MMAI-AGI-Framework.git
cd MMAI-AGI-Framework
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from simulation import MMAISimulation
from experiments import run_nash_equilibrium_experiment

# Run basic Nash equilibrium experiment
results = run_nash_equilibrium_experiment(
    growth_rate=0.1,
    n_agents=100,
    max_steps=1000
)

# Visualize results
results.plot_convergence()
```

## Experimental Validation

Our framework has been validated through five comprehensive experiments:

| Experiment | Key Finding | Validation |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| Nash Equilibrium | Convergence ‚àù Growth Rate | ‚úÖ Power-law relationship confirmed |
| Strategic Fields | Wave-like propagation | ‚úÖ Coherence patterns validated |
| Fractal Time | Multi-scale resonance | ‚úÖ Strong temporal correlations |
| Hypersensitive Points | Strategic choice nexuses | ‚úÖ Environmental chaos correlation |
| Stigmergic Coordination | Indirect coordination | ‚úÖ 10:1 collective/individual ratio |

## Key Results

- **Nash Equilibrium Formation**: Demonstrated proportional relationship between growth rate and equilibrium convergence
- **Strategic Wave Propagation**: Validated wave-like patterns with coherence values evolving from ~0.01 to ~0.09
- **Temporal Resonance**: Strong correlations (0.67-0.82) between metrics across different time scales
- **Emergent Coordination**: Effective stigmergic coordination without direct communication

## Applications

This framework has potential applications in:

- **Swarm Robotics**: Decentralized coordination through strategic fields
- **Distributed AI Systems**: Large-scale coordination without central control
- **Collective Decision Making**: Strategic equilibria in multi-agent systems
- **Autonomous Systems**: Adaptive behavior through memory integration
- **Game Theory**: Extensions to infinite population dynamics
- **Complex Systems Research**: Understanding emergence and self-organization
